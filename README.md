This project demonstrates the time value of money (TVM) concepts through data visualization. Using Python (pandas + matplotlib), it covers:

Future Value (FV): growth of investments over time

Present Value (PV): discounting future cash flows to today

Annuities: level stream of payments over time

Perpetuities: infinite cash flow models

The repository includes financial formulas implemented in Python and their corresponding visual plots, making it easier to understand how money grows, shrinks, or stabilizes under different rates and time horizons.
